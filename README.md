My long-time dream is  to become a frontend developer. Nothing to hide I've had doubts and feared to accomplish my journey. Past year and half I've been practicing my skills in basic HTML/CSS and JS. Recently  I started upgrading my  knowledge in learning Sass and React.js. To sharpen my basic knowledge I’ve followed Youtube tutors and started online course at SkillBox. I know that I’m at the beginning of my path to become a good developer and I hope this page will show you my passion to code.
