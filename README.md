# Portfolio Zhanar Utepbergenova

My long-time dream is  to become a frontend developer. Nothing to hide I've had doubts and feared to accomplish my journey. Past year and half I've been practicing my skills in basic HTML/CSS and JS. 
Recently I've started upgrading my knowledge in learning Sass and React.js. To sharpen my basic knowledge I’ve followed Youtube tutors and started online course at SkillBox. 
I’m at the beginning of my path to become a good developer and hopefully this page will show you my passion to code.
